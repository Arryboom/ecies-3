Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme
===========================================

Simple basic implementation of ECIES.
It is by far not production quality, and serves only as example code.
You may use it, but **PLEASE** improve it A LOT before using it.

It has hard coded key and salt, so you can just run it with OpenSSL >= 1.0.
